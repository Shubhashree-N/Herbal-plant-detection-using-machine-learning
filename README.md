# Herbal-plant-detection-using-machine-learning
The Herbal Plant Detection using Machine Learning project aims to classify and identify medicinal plants based on leaf images. This system utilizes machine learning and deep learning techniques to analyze the leaf’s shape, texture, and color for accurate identification. Users can either upload an image or use real-time scanning to detect the plant. The model is trained on a dataset of medicinal plants and provides detailed information, including the plant’s actual name, biological name, and medicinal properties. This project is highly beneficial for researchers, botanists, and herbal medicine enthusiasts, enabling quick and precise plant identification. It is implemented using Python, TensorFlow/Keras for model training, OpenCV for image processing, and a user-friendly interface for accessibility.
